# WANDERLUST

A basic weather, venues recommendation and news app demonstrating AJAX with Fetch API. Written in React, it makes use of router, React context, React hooks. Material-UI used for CSS.
The app allows you to find recommended venues and current weather for a chosen city using the city search function. The nav link in the header bar will take you to the newsfeed page fetching the lastest news.
Currently used news api is not very fast, so it will take slightly over 3 seconds to load the news page.
Deployed on netlify.

## todo

complete fetching hook with useReducer, integrate for both city-dependent components; add geolocation
